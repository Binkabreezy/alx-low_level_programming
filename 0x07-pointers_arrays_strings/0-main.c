 Project will start Jul 31, 2023 6:00 AM, must end by Aug 1, 2023 6:00 AM
 Checker was released at Jul 31, 2023 12:00 PM
 An auto review will be launched at the deadline
Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

Pointers and arrays


Resources
Read or watch:

C - Pointer to Pointer
C – Pointer to Pointer with example
Multi-dimensional Arrays in C
Two dimensional (2D) arrays in C programming with example
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings
Copyright - Plagiarism
You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar
You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
More Info
You do not need to learn about pointers to functions, arrays of structures, malloc and free - yet.

Quiz questions
Great! You've completed the quiz successfully! Keep going! (Show quiz)
Tasks
0. memset
mandatory
Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte.

Prototype: char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);
The _memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b
Returns a pointer to the memory area s
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: memset. Run man memset to learn more.
